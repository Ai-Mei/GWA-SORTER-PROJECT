# GWA-SORTER-PROJECT
*This program is written in Python language. This algorithm reads a text file containing 20 names of students along with their GWAs. The program will sort out the GWAs from highest to lowest and will identify the student with the highest GWA along with his/her GWA.*

>This project is created by me because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I wrote this program is to learn and explore more in the field of programming

## Project Description
>This program will read the contents of a text file named NAMES-AND-GWA-LIST. Then the algorithm will sort out the GWAs of 20 students listed in the text file and sort them from highest to lowest and identify the student with the highest GWA.

## How to Use?
>To use this program:
.>1. The user will need to download the file.
>2. Once downloaded, open the file with any type of Python Integrated Development Environment or IDE and run the program.
>3. Next, once the program is running, the console will print the description of the program( the grade range, percentage, and description). You will be asked to type in any key to start the sorting of students' GWAs.
>4. After entering, the program will sort the list from the text file.
>5. Then, the program will print the sorted list of the students starting from the student with the highest GWA to the student with the lowest GWA, and display their respective GWAs.
>6. The program will also show the name of the student who got the highest GWA along with the highest GWA.
>7. A text file containing the sorted list with the name of the student with the highest GWA will be created and saved in your directory.

***Happy sorting!***
